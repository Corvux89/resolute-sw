# Resolute Errata Document

The purpose of this document is to have a singular place for errata updates and collating rules from older versions of the SW5e game and returning them to play. Not every errata in here is final, nor will all maneuvers always remain available depending on results of playtesting.
}}
## Server Errata
SW5e is a (polished) homebrew. These are changes we have made to either specific feature wording, items, or other aspects of the SW5e rules to rein in what we believe to be unbalanced or clear up wording for consistent rulings. 

These errata are roughly ordered by the character level in which they may impact you.

### HP on Level Up
Rather than roll for HP or take average, all characters take maximum HP for their class on leveling up.

### Diagonal Movement
We use the 5-10-5 rule for diagonal movement.

### Sentinel Deflection
The Deflection feature of Force-Empowered Self requires a reaction to use.

### Variant: Monks with Lightweapons
If monks gain proficiency with all lightweapons, they may use them as monk weapons, provided the weapon lacks the dexterity, heavy, special, and two-handed properties. 

### Alternative Focuses
A version of the Variant: Alternative Focuses rule is allowed in play. Engineers may install wristpad modifications into their archetype focus. Jedi, if they have an archetype focus, may install generator mods.

### Sentinel Style
The wording of **Sentinel Style** has been changed to the following: "Creatures provoke an opportunity attack when they move to within your reach or move 5 feet or greater while within your reach. When you hit a creature that is no more than one size larger than you with **this** opportunity attack, that creature gains 4 slowed levels until the end of the current turn.

### Unstable Engineering
The second paragraph of **Modified Tinkercannon** has been changed to the following: "Once per turn, you can roll 1d20 immediately after you cast a tech power of 1st level or higher while wielding your tinkercannon. If you roll a 20, roll on the Unstable Engineering Surge table to create a random effect."

### Tiers of Proficiency
- Saving Throws are limited to **Proficiency.** This limit can be bypassed by feats.
- Skill checks are limited to **Expertise.** 
- Spellcasting ability checks are limited to **Expertise.**

### Damage Reduction
**Damage Reduction** is capped at 6 from passive effects (i.e. **Absorptive**, **Jensaarai Set**, **Defensive Mastery**)
:
Regardless of damage type, this reduction can only be applied once per attack and only for 6 damage per attack. For instance, if Darth Optimus Prime hits for 2d8 energy damage and 2d8 necrotic damage, your damage reduction would apply to either energy or necrotic, but not both.

### Prone Condition Clarification
Being knocked prone knocks targets to the ground, whether they are climbing or flying. Creatures may flatten themselves against a wall or ceiling, but it does not grant the prone condition. 

### Hiding Variant

With the Hide action, you try to conceal yourself. To do so, you must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth) check while you’re Heavily Obscured or behind Three-Quarters Cover or Total Cover, and you must be out of any enemy’s line of sight; if you can see a creature, you can discern whether it can see you.

On a successful check, you have the Invisible condition. Make note of your check’s total, which is the DC for a creature to find you with a Wisdom (Perception) check.

The condition ends on you immediately after any of the following occurs: you make a sound louder than a whisper, an enemy finds you, you make an attack roll, you cast a power, or you end a turn while not Heavily Obscured or behind Three-Quarters Cover or Total Cover from any enemy's line of sight.

### Maneuvers
Specific classes and subclasses have access to different maneuvers, as defined in Content Rulings. Certain maneuvers not available on the SW5e website are available on the next page.

### Fighting Masteries
You may only benefit from additional attacks from one Fighting Mastery per turn.

For instance, you cannot make an extra attack from using Form-Fighting Mastery to activate a form and from Throwing Mastery in the same turn.

### Additional Maneuvers
#### Snare Traps
You can use an action and expend a superiority die to trigger painful snare traps. When you do, one creature within 60 feet of you or all creatures that are targeted by your Critical Analysis must make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against your maneuver save DC.

On a failure, they take damage equal to the roll and their movement speed becomes 0 until the end of your next turn.
#### Superior Counterattack
Whenever an opportunity attack targets a friendly creature other than you that is in an area targeted by your Critical Analysis feature, you can expend a superiority die. The creature can use its reaction to make a single weapon attack, adding the superiority die roll to the attack roll.
#### All In
When you make an attack roll, and the result is less than 20, you can expend a superiority die and roll it, adding it to the roll. If the resulting sum is 20 or 23, the attack is considered a critical hit.
#### Blind Luck
When you fail an ability check, you can expend a superiority die. If the result of your ability check plus the superiority die is within a range equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down) above or below the check’s DC, you pass the check instead.

#### Double Bluff
If on the same round of combat that you have missed a weapon attack, an enemy also misses you with a weapon attack, you can expend a superiority die and make a single weapon attack, adding the results of your superiority die to both the attack and damage rolls.
#### Idiot's Array
When a creature hits you with a weapon attack roll, you can expend a superiority die and roll it. On a roll of 4 or higher, you take minimum damage on the damage roll and subtract the value of the superiority die. On a roll of 3 or lower, you instead take the maximum.
#### Raise the Stakes
When the target of your Critical Analysis feature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to expend a superiority die. Roll the die and subtract the result from the enemy’s attack roll, but add the result to their damage roll on a hit.
#### Tiebreaker
When you roll a superiority die as a part of a maneuver you learned from this class, you can expend another superiority die and use the total of both dice.

\column

#### Acid Burst
When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with a sudden and violent expulsion of acidic fluid. You expend a superiority die, and cause all creatures within a 15-foot cone originating from you to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they take damage equal to the number rolled on your superiority die plus your maneuver modifier.
#### Electrical Discharge
When you succeed on a check to initiate or maintain a grapple, you can expend a superiority die. The creature takes lightning damage equal to the amount rolled on the die.
#### Venomous Slash
When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you may expend a superiority die to force it to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes poison damage equal to the result of the die and is poisoned until the start of your next turn.

## Item Errata
In addition to the items found in the Player's Handbook, Wretched Hives, and Extra Content, we have created some additional items and made changes to items already created within the ruleset. Those changes and items can be found as follows.
}}

## Item Errata
### Friction Grip Gear
Friction Grip Gear is now an **Enhanced Premium** item that requires attunement.

|+1 Increase|-1 Decrease|
|:-:|:-:|
|Strength|Intelligence|
|Dexterity|Wisdom|

|Intelligence|Strength|
|Wisdom|Dexterity|
|Charisma|Constitution|

### Storing Property
Storing items must start every server activity empty.

### Silent Property
The silent property has been removed from the game. Items that have it or grant it no longer have the property or are not available for purchase.

### Additional Damage Dice
Items can only benefit from one Item Modification that adds additional damage dice, like Quantum Splitters, Ostrine Crystals or Shocking Oscillators.

### Stat Boosting Items
You must have 10 or higher in an Ability Score to use an item that sets or raises it to 15. You must have 15 or higher in an Ability Score to use an item that sets or raises it above 15.

### Shield Proficiency
Proficiency in Light Shields grants proficiency in Medium Shields. If your starting equipment gives you a Light Shield, take a Medium Shield.

### AC Boosts
Total Enhanced Item bonus to AC cannot exceed +3

### Augments

Rather than using chassis, every character will start with an Augment Item that they can use to slot in a number of Augments equal to their proficiency bonus. We recommend this take the form of a unique item provided by your background, such as a bracer, a chain of coins, or a trinket.

You can't have more than one of the exact same augment.

### Color Crystals
Classes start with a color crystal designated for their class - Guardians blue, Sentinels yellow, and Consulars green, or red.

All other classes that gain access to a lightsaber through some means can pick one of the above four.

Any lightsabers you gain or purchase will have the same color as your starting one did when you acquired it.
