# Character Rules
## Experience and Leveling
Disregard experience. You will be using a certain amount of Chain Codes (CC) to acquire each successive level. More information about Chain Codes and how they can be acquired can be found in [Activities](https://discord.com/channels/831690964140687440/1286551882407477311). The amount of Chain Codes required per level can be found in [Market - Cost Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cTNxBozByX7-yjX5lqBRIHW3kZ7MI2k9mrblB8mHPzY/edit?usp=sharing)

To level up, purchase it first using the [Galactic Market](https://discord.com/channels/831690964140687440/1069327231622586389) and then you may request your level up.
## Tiers and Server Level Cap
Throughout the server and server rules, we will refer to tiers, which roughly correspond with 5e's tiers of play, with some additions of ours. They are as follows:

Tier List

|< Level > | < Tier > | < Tier Role >|
|----------|----------|--------------|
| 1-3      |    1     |   Carbonite  |
|  4-6     |    2     |   Chromium   |
|  7-10    |    3     |   Trimantium |
|  11-14   |    4     |   Orichalc   |
|  15-18   |    5     |   Slivian    |
|  19-20   |    6     |   Aurodium   |

### Server Level Cap
```Current Server Level Cap: 5```
In order to keep the majority of the server around the same power level and in the golden zone of play, we have introduced a Server Level Cap, which will be increased by Server Milestones - usually from certain completed Shatterpoints. You may only level to the current Server Level Cap. There will be alternate things to spend your CCs on, so don't worry about not having anything to progress!
## Multiclassing
Multiclassing can only take place directly after an ASI. The new class chosen must span all levels until another ASI is reached. Then another class, or a prior one may follow that one. This is designed to reduce potential power-gaming, and encourage people to multiclass purely for roleplay reasons.
## Character Limit
You are allowed to play a number of characters equal to your tier. Characters may participate in more than one activity at a time. 

Players unlock new character slots as they reach new tiers.  Reaching Tier 2 unlocks Character Slot 2, Tier 3 unlocks Slot 3, etc.

No two characters can exist in the same tier. If you have a character in Tier 2 and a character in Tier 1, the Tier 1 character cannot level up into Tier 2 until the Tier 2 character either reaches Tier 3 or is deleveled via ModMail.

Your characters cannot be in the same activities as one another or trade items or credits amongst each other, but they may interact in Snapshots.

Second characters and on start at level 3.
## Death
When your character dies or you decide to Death Reroll, you free up a slot in your lineup. 

Your new character can do one of two things:
1. Start at the lowest level of the same adventuring tier as the dead character. The new character gets half of the dead character's lifetime credits and adventure rewards, rounded up. 
  - **Note:** These new adventure rewards cannot be items that specifically require Personal Mission completion, unless they are augments.
2. Swap their tier with your next highest character, if they are at tier cap. The new character starts at the highest level of the previous tier, and the character you're swapping receives a free level up.
## Rerolls
On occasion, you might find that you do not like the character you built, or you failed to take advantage of one of SW5e's *many* varied features that you would like to. You can reroll your character **ONE** time with no penalty, excepting very special circumstances. Submit your reroll with all of the new/changed information as well as clarifying that you are using a Free Reroll. Afterwards, you must treat rerolls as if your character has died or purchase the reroll option in the market.

If you are changing your class with a reroll, purchased equipment or trainings are refunded as part of the reroll at current market rate, and adventure rewards can be traded like-for-like.
## Sith
At this time, players will not be permitted to play as Sith - being as they are supposedly no longer in existence. They are the villains of this story, and players having them as characters would lead to PVP, which is a stated goal of this server to primarily avoid. 

Dark Jedi are permitted, but be sure to keep in mind the stance on truly Evil characters in [Getting Started](https://discord.com/channels/831690964140687440/1286551938334326806).

# Further Reading
We have errata'd certain SW5e rules and ported over rules from the new 5e ruleset, as well as established rulings on several variants or clarified wording. These can be found in the [Resolute Errata Document](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-NzUwtWj3d9pFIdfDotM). Please read it carefully - we have organized it by our best estimation of when it will be useful for character creation.

In addition, we are working on porting over many items and creating new items for the SW5e ruleset, which can be found in the [Resolute Homebrew Document](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-ODwGI3WLonaqXgRUZW8).

Both documents are subject to grow and change over time.
